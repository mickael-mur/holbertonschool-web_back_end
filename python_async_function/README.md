# Python - Async

This project covers asynchronous programming in Python using `asyncio`.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- All files must be executable
- Code should use `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x)
- All modules and functions must be type-annotated

## Tasks

### 0. The basics of async
File: `0-basic_async_syntax.py`

### 1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async
File: `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`

### 2. Measure the runtime
File: `2-measure_runtime.py`

### 3. Tasks
File: `3-tasks.py`

### 4. Tasks
File: `4-tasks.py`
