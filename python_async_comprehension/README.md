# Python Async Comprehension

This directory contains exercises on coroutines and asynchronous comprehensions in Python.

## Files

- `0-async_generator.py`: A coroutine that generates 10 random numbers, waiting 1 second at each iteration.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: A coroutine that uses an async comprehension to collect 10 numbers generated by `async_generator`.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: A coroutine that measures the execution time of 4 asynchronous comprehensions launched in parallel.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how coroutines and the `asyncio` module work.
- Know how to use `async for` and async comprehensions.
- Learn to measure the execution time of asynchronous tasks.

Don't forget to complete each file with your own code and test with the provided `*-main.py` files.
